# Serverless360 BAM for ASP.NET applications
This repository contains ASP.NET library which allows you to log activities to Serverless360 Business Activity Monitoring Solution.

## Introduction
[Serverless360](https://www.serverless360.com/) is one platform to manage and monitor Azure Serverless components related to enterprise integration.

Serverless360 BAM can be used for functional end to end business activity tracking and monitoring for Azure integration scenarios involving Azure Functions, API's and Azure Logic Apps. With Serverless360 BAM get full visibility of your end to end business process flow across all your components from a single portal.

Currently with services like Logic Apps we provide a custom connector which you can deploy in your subscription if you want to track activities. For other services you can use our Azure Functions to track activities. But since it is hard for every customer to implement their own logic for communicating our APIs we think this library can reduce that effort vastly.
